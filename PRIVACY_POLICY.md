# Privacy Policy
## What information does the app collect?
The app collects no personal information about it's users, only the current game state, and *attempts* to send as little identifiable information in it's API requests as possible. The extension itself works in a serverless context and there is no backend it phones back home to. The only API requests made are to official Granblue Fantasy game servers and if required translation services such as DeepL or AI solutions. The latter is only done at user's behest.

## How is the information used?
The information is used to present the game's dialogue in an alternative language to the user, and to possibly auto-translate it. There is no other information collected or used.

## 3rd party services
The extension may require the use of third party libraries and services such as translation services. The user will be made aware of use of these services and will have to agree to their terms of service and privacy policy.

## Information collection.
The extension does not collect any personal information about the user, and only collects the game's dialogue and state. The extension does not collect any information about the user's browsing habits or any other personal information.
In the future if new features are required to use personal information, the user will be made aware of this and will have to agree to the collection of this information.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, we advise you to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately, after they are posted on this page.
